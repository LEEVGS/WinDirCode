# WinDirCode
Cleans the temp files from a directory path (doesn't delete the folders)

# Usage
Write the path you want to scan like **C:/** or **D:/Projects** and if you want to delete the file (y/n).

I would strongly recommend you scan one time without the delete and check if the files are valid to be deleted.

# Scan conditions
## Folders with name
- .vs
- TempFiles
